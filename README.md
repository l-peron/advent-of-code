# advent-of-code-2023

- Day 01: Initial attempt encountered difficulties, particularly with problem 2 due to overthinking.

- Day 02: Increased confidence, resulting in a cleaner and faster solution compared to day 01. However, there were still unnecessary instructions.

- Day 03: Encountered numerous problems with edge cases. Effectiveness was limited, but managed to succeed using various tricks.

- Day 04: Progressed rapidly. Faced some minor issues with understanding problem 2, but it still seems manageable.

- Day 05: Part one was easy, and I encountered no problems. Part two involved dealing with intervals instead of numbers, which was a more conceptual approach, and I had difficulty understanding it initially. However, once I grasped the concept, writing the code was easy.

- Day 06: Easy. Could have used dichotomy for problem 2, but I was too lazy, and O(n) is still a good complexity in my opinion. We don't lose that much compared to O(log(n)).
